Github integration for git
==========================

With this git subcommand, you can perform various github actions, such as
creating or forking a repository from the command line.

Install instructions:

You need to install requests, whelk and github3.py first. requests and whelk
can be installed with pip, github3.py (as of writing) needs to be cloned from
github as the released versions are not quite there yet.

With those prerequisites met, place git-hub somewhere on your $PATH or in git's
libexec dir, and you're done.
