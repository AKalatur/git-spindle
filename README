Github integration for git
==========================

With this git subcommand, you can perform various github actions, such as
creating or forking a repository from the command line.

Usage: 

$ git hub add-remote [user]: Add user's fork as a remote by that name
$ git hub create: Create a repository on github to push to
$ git hub fork [url or user and repo]: Fork a repo and clone it
$ git hub forks: List all forks of this repository
$ git hub gist [files]: Create a new gist from files
$ git hub issue [issue number ...]: Issue details
$ git hub issues [filters]: List issues
$ git hub set-origin: Set the remote 'origin' to github.
  If this is a fork, set the remote 'upstream' to the parent
$ git hub whoami: Display github user info
$ git hub whois [user ...]: Display github user info

Install instructions:

You need to install whelk and github3.py first. whelk can be installed with
pip, github3.py (as of writing) needs to be cloned from github as the released
versions are not quite there yet.

With those prerequisites met, place git-hub somewhere on your $PATH or in git's
libexec dir, and you're done.
