git-spindle testsuite
=====================
This is the testsuite for git-spindle. It is not easy to use, as it requires at
least ten accounts on various different services. If you still want to have a
go at it, these instructions should help.


Accounts
--------
You will need 3 accounts on each of gitlab.com, bitbucket.org and github.com.
The word 'test' must appear in their name. You will also need a local GitLab
instance, where a user 'Seveas' must exist and have a public repo 'whelk'.

All these accounts must be added to a .gitspindle file in this directory. It's
probably easiest to add them to your local .gitspindle file with the
add-account command and then copy them over.

Note that for GitHub accounts you must manually grant the delete_repo scope
after creating the account. This can be done on
https://github.com/settings/applications

The git-spindle account names are hardcoded as below:

[gitlab "gitlab-test-1"]
[gitlab "gitlab-test-2"]
[gitlab "gitlab-test-3"]
[gitlab "gitlab-test-local"]

[github "github-test-1"]
[github "github-test-2"]
[github "github-test-3"]

[bitbucket "bitbucket-test-1"]
[bitbucket "bitbucket-test-2"]
[bitbucket "bitbucket-test-3"]

After creating the .gitspindle file, copy over the [github "github-test-1"]
section to a [github] section. Same for gitlab and bitbucket.


Running the testsuite
---------------------
While setting up tests is difficult, running them is as easy as 'make test' and
grabbing a cup of coffee. Each individual test can be run by simply running it
from the test directory. But beware that quite a few tests depend on each
other, so make sure any failures you get when doing this are not the result of
this fact.


Adding to the testsuite
-----------------------
The testsuite is divided in sections for different functionality. When you add
a test, add it to the right section.

0xx: basics, cleanups and users
1xx: repo creation (create, clone, fork, forks, parent, set_origin, add_remote)
2xx: repo inspection (browse, cat, ls)
3xx: issues (issue, issues, pull requests, apply)
4xx: misc goodies (mirroring, log, hooks/services)
9xx: github goodies (gists, calendar, ignore, say, status, network, render)
