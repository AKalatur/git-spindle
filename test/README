git-spindle testsuite
=====================
This is the testsuite for git-spindle. It is not easy to use, as it requires at
least ten accounts on various different services. If you still want to have a
go at it, these instructions should help.


Accounts
--------
You will need 3 accounts on each of gitlab.com, bitbucket.org and github.com.
The word 'test' must appear in their name. You will also need a local GitLab
instance, where a user 'seveas' must exist and have a public repo named
'whelk'.

All these accounts must be added to a .gitspindle file in this directory. It's
not a normal .gitspindle file, please see the example in this directory. Note
that the testsuite will add extra sections to this configfile storing the
access tokens.

Running the testsuite
---------------------
While setting up tests is difficult, running them is as easy as 'make test' and
grabbing a cup of coffee. Each individual test can be run by simply running it
from the test directory. But beware that quite a few tests depend on each
other, so make sure any failures you get when doing this are not the result of
this fact.

The testsuite pays attention to the following environment variables:
NO_GITHUB       -- don't test github
NO_BITBUCKET    -- don't test bitbucket
NO_GITLAB       -- don't test gitlab
NO_GITLAB_LOCAL -- don't test a local gitlab instance
AUTHORTESTS     -- run tests only the author needs to run

Adding to the testsuite
-----------------------
The testsuite is divided in sections for different functionality. When you add
a test, add it to the right section.

0xx: basics, cleanups and users
1xx: repo creation (create, clone, fork, forks, parent, set_origin, add_remote)
2xx: repo inspection (browse, cat, ls)
3xx: issues (issue, issues, pull requests, apply)
4xx: misc goodies (mirroring, log, hooks/services)
9xx: github goodies (gists, calendar, ignore, say, status, network, render)
